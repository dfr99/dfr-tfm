# CONTRIBUTING

## Gitflow Development Workflow

We follow the Gitflow development workflow for this project. Gitflow is a branching model that provides a structured approach to managing feature development, releases, and hotfixes.

### Branches

- **Main Branch (master):** The main branch represents the production-ready state of the project. It should always contain stable and tested code.

- **Develop Branch (dev):** The develop branch is used for ongoing development. Feature branches are created from this branch and merged back into it once the development is complete.

- **Feature Branches (feature/):** Feature branches are created from the develop branch and are used to develop new features or enhancements. Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into the develop branch.

- **Bug Branches (bug/):** Bug branches are created from the develop branch to solve issues or fix non-critical errors in the development code. Once the bug is fixed, it is merged back into the develop branch.

- **Hotfix Branches (hotfix/):** Hotfix branches are created from the main branch to address critical issues in the production code. Once the hotfix is complete, it is merged into both the main and develop branches.
